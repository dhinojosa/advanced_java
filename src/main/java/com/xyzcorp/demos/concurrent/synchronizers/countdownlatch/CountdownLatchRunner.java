 * Countdown latch
 *
 * Sometimes you will want a thread to wait until one or more events have
 * occurred. To handle such a situation, the concurrent API supplies
 * CountDownLatch. A CountDownLatch is initially created with a count of the
 * number of events that must occur before the latch is released. Each time
 * an event happens, the count is decremented. When the count reaches zero,
 * the latch opens.
